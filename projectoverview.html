<h3>Project Overview</h3>
</center>
<BR>
<font size="3">
<p>American women’s involvement in the nineteenth-century bicycle industry was multifaceted and key to the industry as a whole, even though men held leadership positions in bicycle companies. Women designed and produced bicycle accessories and clothing, while others developed frames and components. Women also worked in bicycle shops in sales and even as mechanics, and it was common for bicycle corporations to hire women as sales ‘agents’ to promote their brand. Other women quietly worked their way up to management positions in local factories. Young, working- class women were the invisible laborers behind most components and accessories, working long hours in dangerous machine shops and factory floors. </P>
<P></P>There are a wealth of sources on women in the bicycle industry, yet they are largely scattered across archives. This disconnect can make it seem as though each individual woman’s contribution to bicycling was an outlining example and not part of a broader trend. Wheelwomen at Work brings together newspaper articles, patents, government documents, and bicycling periodicals to create a more complete understanding of women’s contributions to the nineteenth-century bicycle industry. Each pin documents a woman or group of women’s involvement in the bicycling industry. The pins are color coded to represent four major categories of wheelwomen’s work:<BR>
Factory Workers, Saleswomen, Inventors and Mechanics.
</p>
<P>
By mapping and documenting these sources, Wheelwomen at Work hopes to provide a crossroads for sport history, women’s history and business history. Scholars have understood cycling primarily through men’s athleticism and innovation, regulating women’s bicycling to short chapters, chapter sections, or footnotes despite the widespread popularity of bicycling among women. The historiography of the American bicycle industry is overwhelming a story of men’s successes and failures, typically with a focus on major corporations. The few historians who have incorporated women into bicycling research have only considered women as consumers and there is little scholarship which recognizes and explores women as innovators and producers in this industry. Similarly, scholars who have incorporated women have focused solely on the middle- and upper-classes, and have yet to consider working-class women as meaning contributors to bicycling culture and industry. Uncovering women’s involvement in the bicycle industry speaks to significant gaps within the history of sport, business history, and women’s history. It also responds to calls by women’s historians such as Susan Lewis Ingalls to rethink the male-normative frameworks of business history, as well as calls for social histories of capitalism. Yet, Wheelwomen at Work is designed for all cycling enthusiasts, scholars and lay riders alike. It ultimately hopes to contribute to conversations of bicycling culture in the classrooms and libraries, as well as bike shops, races and leisurely rides among fellow cyclists.
